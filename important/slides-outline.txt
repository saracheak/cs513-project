Slide 1: Title Slide
    - Project Name: Stock Price Prediction with Multi-Agent Validation
    - Names of all presenters
    - Photos of all presenters

Slide 2: The Problem
    - Stock market prediction is non-linear and chaotic.
    - The Gap: Deep Learning models are "Black Boxes"—they give a number but no reasoning.
    - Our Solution: A Neuro-Symbolic approach combining LSTM with Agentic AI for validation.

Slide 3: Data Pipeline
    - Source: Yahoo Finance (AAPL, TSLA, MSFT).
    - Uniqueness: Custom Web Scraper for FinViz sentiment data.
    - Features: 15 Technical Indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.).
    - Preprocessing: MinMax Scaling, Time-Series sequences (60-day lookback).

Slide 4: Methodology - The Neural Networks
    - Baseline: ANN (3 Layers).
    - Advanced: LSTM (2 Layers).
    - Novelty: Attention-LSTM (Focuses on specific historical days).
    - Visual: Diagram of Attention weights.

Slide 5: Methodology - The Multi-Agent System (Bonus Requirement)
    - Technical Agent: "If RSI > 70, doubt the bullish prediction."
    - Sentiment Agent: Scrapes news -> TextBlob -> Sentiment Score.
    - Meta-Agent: Calculates confidence weighted average (70% Tech / 30% Sentiment).
    - Logic: If Agents disagree with LSTM, the prediction is dampened/adjusted.

Slide 6: Results - Quantitative
    - Comparison: ANN vs. LSTM vs. Attention vs. Agent-Enhanced.
    - Key Stat: Agent System improved MSFT accuracy by 11.53%.
    - Key Stat: AAPL improved by 7.45%.
    - Nuance: TSLA performed best with raw Attention-LSTM (Agents were too conservative on volatile memes).

Slide 7: Results - Qualitative
    - Visual: Show the graph of MSFT Prediction vs. Actual.
    - Visual: Show the "Agent Adjustment" bar chart (green/red bars) from the notebook.
    - Directional Accuracy: ~53% (Consistent with efficient market hypothesis).

Slide 8: Conclusion & Future Work
    - Conclusion: Hybrid Neuro-Symbolic AI creates robust, explainable financial models.
    - Future Work: Replace LSTM with Transformers; Integrate Reddit/Twitter API for faster sentiment.
